It meanders from one unsatisfactorily resolved complication to another, crossing the line between a slow-burning thriller and one that entirely fails to ignite.\"[^1^]
- **Rotten Tomatoes**: Nandini Ramnath gave the film a positive review and wrote: \"Although Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! works hard on creating a convincing setting for Byomkesh to make his mark, the characters are mostly under-written and the central mystery lacks tension and a sense of imminent danger.\"[^4^]
- **Times of India**: Meena Iyer gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Straight up, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! is possibly India's best-looking sleuth flick till now. But it's also a case of being oversold on its smartness. The film is clever - but it could've been sharper.\"[^5^]
