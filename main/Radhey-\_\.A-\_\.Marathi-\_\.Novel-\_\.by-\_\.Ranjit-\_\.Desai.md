The novel portrays Karna as a complex and conflicted character, who struggles with his identity, loyalty, and destiny. He is born as the son of Surya, the sun god, and Kunti, a princess, but is abandoned by his mother and left in a basket on a river. He is adopted by Radha and Adhiratha, a charioteer of King Dhritarashtra. He grows up as a friend of Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, who are at war with their cousins, the Pandavas. He becomes a great warrior and archer, but is denied his rightful place in society because of his low caste. He is also rejected by Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, who insults him for being a sutaputra (son of a charioteer). He is loyal to Duryodhana, who gives him the kingdom of Anga and respects him as an equal. He is also devoted to Krishna, who tries to persuade him to join the Pandavas, but fails. He faces many challenges and dilemmas in his life, such as his love for Vrishali, his encounter with his biological mother Kunti, his rivalry with Arjuna, and his death at the hands of Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war.
